# The DMV

## *Description*
This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.
### **Process to for learning this code base.**
1. Reviewing the error message
* Reviewing the individual classes,  the Facility class interacts with the Dmv class
* Should have reviewed all files before beginning to debug to understand how they work together

2. Its challenging in many ways to decipher code you did not write because it takes time to understand what they are trying to achieve.  Also it save oneself the time from writing their own

3. It wasn't terrible jumping into this unfamiliar codebase, it is very similar to  what we have learned.
