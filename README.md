# The DMV

## *Description*
This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.
### Process to for learning this code base.
1. **Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.**
First I would review the error message, then the individual classes.  The Facility class interacts with the Dmv class and I should have reviewed all files before beginning to debug to understand how they work together

2. **What was hard about working with code you did not write?**
Its challenging in many ways to decipher code you did not write because it takes time to understand what they are trying to achieve.  However, it also saves time from writing your own code

3. **What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?**
It is similar to what we have learned.  I was surprised that it didn't take too long to figure out what the bugs were in Iteration1.  However later in Iteration_2 and Iteration_3 I found much more challenging working with unfamiliar API data.
