# The DMV

## *Description*
This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.
### Process to for learning this code base.
1. **Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.**
* Reviewing the error message
* Reviewing the individual classes, the Facility class interacts with the Dmv class
* Should have reviewed all files before beginning to debug to understand how they work together

2. **What was hard about working with code you did not write?**
Its challenging in many ways to decipher code you did not write because it takes time to understand what they are trying to achieve.  Also it save oneself the time from writing their own

3. **What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?**
It is similar to  what we have learned.  I was surprised that it didn't take too long to figure out what the bugs were.
